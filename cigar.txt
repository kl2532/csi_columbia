CIGAR: CIGAR string. The CIGAR operations are given in the following table (set ‘*’ if unavailable):
Op BAM Description
M 0 alignment match (can be a sequence match or mismatch)
I 1 insertion to the reference
D 2 deletion from the reference
N 3 skipped region from the reference
S 4 soft clipping (clipped sequences present in SEQ)
H 5 hard clipping (clipped sequences NOT present in SEQ)
P 6 padding (silent deletion from padded reference)
= 7 sequence match
X 8 sequence mismatch
• H can only be present as the first and/or last operation.
• S may only have H operations between them and the ends of the CIGAR string.
• For mRNA-to-genome alignment, an N operation represents an intron. For other types of alignments,
the interpretation of N is not defined.
• Sum of lengths of the M/I/S/=/X operations shall equal the length of SEQ
