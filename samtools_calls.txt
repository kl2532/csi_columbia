# Creates .bam file from .sam
samtools view -b -S -o aln1.bam aln1.sam

# Creates aln1sorted.bam (ordered by chromosome)
samtools sort aln1.bam aln1sorted

# Creates bcf (can use sorted bam too)
samtools mpileup -uf h19.fasta aln1sorted.bam > aln1.bcf

# So 0x904 is equivalent to 2308 in base 10. 
# This means that bits 4 (unmapped), 256 (secondary alignment), and 2048 (supplementary alignment) are set 
# and the "-F" option to samtools view then indicates that any record with one of these bits set is to be ignored.
# This returns the number of reads aligned.
samtools view -F 0x904 -c aln1sorted.bam

# Look at the mappings (just interesting):
samtools flagstat aln1sorted.bam
